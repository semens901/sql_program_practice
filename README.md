# sql_program_practice
The program was prepared during practical training. The program creates a table with the phone book, you can fill it out, add lines, delete them, all information is saved.

Start to use:
First you need to set up your mariadb server, then fill in the fields when logging into the application: ip address, database name, username and password and click connect.

Next step:
The add button adds a line, when you select any element in the line, you can delete the line by pressing the delete button. The line will be cleared, if you close the application and open it again, we can see that this line no longer exists.

This application was developed by me for the purpose of learning to work with MySql
